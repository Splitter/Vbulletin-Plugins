What does it do?
Allows a user to be assigned to a certain usergroup based on a drop down menu at registration time.


1. This will work with email verification. So you can still require email verification for all new users and they will be assigned to the appropriate usergroup after their email has been verified.
2. It will automatically draw in the usergroup names for the ids instead of having you type out both the usergroup ID's and usergroup names.



Installation:
1. Import the product
2. Go to AdminCP->vbulletin Options->Vbulletin Options->VB Usergroup Choice on Register
and set up the options the way you want...

Notes:
Will add 1 query when showing the registration form.
Will add 1 more query to the processing of a registration if VB is set up for every user having to verify email addresses.
