# Troll/Spam spotter mod

How it works is that in the options you can set a time limit and post limit. So lets say you set the time limit to 1 hour and the post limit to 15 posts. If a user registers and makes 15 posts within the first hour after they register they will be added to the 'tachy users go to coventry' list. It will then PM an admin to have them review the users activity to confirm that whether the user is truly a troll/spammer and take the appropriate action.
    
You can also optionally have the mod automatically soft-delete all the posts/threads the potential spammer/troll has already made.
    
And you can also have it optionally move the user to another usergroup, such as the miserable users usergroup if that mod is installed or just a usergroup with a more limited permissions base.
